            <h2>Word Software Manual Project</h2>
            <p>This was a semester-long assignment for which the final receivable was a modular software documentation manual based on the functions of Microsoft Word, made completely in Microsoft Word. I chose my intended audience as college freshmen and my topic as essay writing in Word. Below I’ve included the final manual, the usability testing process, and the preliminary doc plan. In this project, I think my technical documentation knowledge and publication skills really shine!</p>

                        <embed src="pdf/WordManual.pdf" width="500" height="550">
                        <p>My final project ended up being a thirty-three-page manual with five chapters and fifteen different modules. I learned and implemented all of the best practices for technical writing, particularly in a modular two-page spread format. After the content, I focused a lot on details like my chapter page designs, call-outs, color scheme, and notes, so I am especially proud of the overall design of this project.

                        <embed src="pdf/UsabilityTesting.pdf" width="500" height="550">
                        <p>One of the most important parts of technical writing is a focus on usability, and I believe these documents show my attention to user-centric communication. Per my intended audience, I had freshman volunteers use my manual to make edits to an essay I had created so that I could see how a user would interact with my manual to troubleshoot my content and structure. The script I created to perform the usability testing and my memo reflection from afterward are above! </p>

                        <p>Preliminary doc plans are essential for big projects, and I think this plan speaks to my attention to detail and big-picture thinking. Before creating the Word manual, I submitted this documentation plan outlining my user analysis, and project schedule, as well as the tools, resources, and receivables. </p>

            <h2>Mock Grant Proposal</h2>
            <p>This was a semester-long assignment for which the final receivable was a hypothetical grant proposal or request for funding on behalf of a non-profit of our choice for some viable project. Below, I’ve included my final proposal and the corresponding feasibility study. I believe this project showcases my research and professional writing capability!</p>

                        <p>My final 22-page report entails a request for funding for a hypothetical event series aimed at promoting and providing sustainable fashion practices in the Amherst community on behalf of non-profit Fashion Revolution USA. It entails all of the conventions of a legitimate grant proposal including a statement of need and associated research, a description of proposed work, a criteria for judging success, a schedule overview, an expense breakdown, and more.</p>

                        <p>Per the usual grant-writing process, I wrote a feasibility study on the topic before I actually started the grant writing. I think this study is indicative of the time I put into every piece of a project and shows my professional writing skills. </p>

            <h2>MadCap Flare Accessibility Website/PDF</h2>
            <p>This project consisted of utilizing Madcap Flare to create a website explaining digital accessibility best practices. Digital accessibility is a huge part of web design to create inclusive digital spaces and increase the scope of users who can utilize your product or content. This project was a way to learn about digital accessibility best practices, communicate them to a broader audience, and use them ourselves! Per the “About This Site” page, some of this project was done collaboratively. I’ve included the final website output as well as the final PDF output below.</p>
