                        <h2>Capitalism in the Age of the Internet</h2>
                        <embed src="pdf/CapitalismInTheAgeofTheInternet.pdf" width="500" height="550">
                        <p>The assignment for this project was to write two-thousand words on just about anything, and this ended up being one of my favorite pieces of mine. I chose to talk about modern economics, or more specifically, the intersection of digitalism with capitalism and all the things that go with that: surveillance capitalism, monopolies in tech, the social power of data extraction, the redefinition of industry, the gig economy and how all those things tie together.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Most Influential Megatrends of the Future: Technology</h2>
                        <embed src="pdf/MegatrendsArticleIITech.pdf" width="500" height="550">
                        <p>This was a partnered paper assignment in which two people wrote about what life could be like in twenty years or beyond. The first article was written by my partner about sustainability, and I wrote the entirety of the article above about the effects of technology on the (nearer) future. In this paper, I talk about how technology will impact the climate crisis, corporate responsibility, automation, and more. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Data and Surveillance | Policy Trends</h2>
                        <embed src="pdf/DataandSurveillance.pdf" width="500" height="550">
                        <p>This was a final reflection assignment where we were supposed to talk about our opinion of the works we’d looked at in class in regards to data, surveillance, and policy trends in the future. In this, I unpack the main pieces of writing we talked about in class and give my take on them. Mainly, I talk about why data extraction is not inherently “bad” technology, but rather the lack of transparency and the motivation behind data extraction has landed us dangerously close to an era of surveillance capitalism.  </p>
